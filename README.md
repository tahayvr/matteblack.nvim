## Screenshots

## Features

## Installation

### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "tahayvr/matteblack.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  config = function()
    vim.cmd.colorscheme "matteblack"
  end,
}
```

I've only tested this with lazy.nvim, but it should work with other plugin managers.

## Configuration

TBD: Customization options will be added soon.
